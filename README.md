# Annotated Portfolio Prototype
This is an early version of some kind of tool to deal with design references. 
The first version of this tool, most likely the one found in this commit, was made for the course [Studio I](https://utbildningsinfo.mau.se/kurs/kursplan/KD417A/20221) at Malm√∂ University.
It has since developed (at least in my mind) into something that could be more general/an expanded kind of annotated portfolio that features some [Subconcious](https://subconscious.substack.com)-like auto-presentation/discovery of relationships. Maybe.
It could also just be one of those designerly Pinterest copies, who knows.

## Build
