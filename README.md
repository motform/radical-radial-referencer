# Radial Radial Referencer
This is an pedagogical experiment of some kind of tool to deal with design references. 
The first version of this tool, most likely the one found in this commit, was made for the course [Studio I](https://utbildningsinfo.mau.se/kurs/kursplan/KD417A/20221) at Malm√∂ University.

For more information, see read [the case study on my website](https://motform.org/malmo-university.html).
